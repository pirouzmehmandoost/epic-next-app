This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

This project implements [shadcn/ui] on the front end and [Strapi] on the back end, and uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Note that Strapi requires Active LTS or Maintenance LTL versions of Node.js (v18, v20) off number releases are not supported.
